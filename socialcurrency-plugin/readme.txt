When a user comes back to the site and reads a post, offer them the ability to share the article with their Facebook friends. This leads to more inbound traffic for you, and a faster, cleaner browsing experience for them.

1. Save the AppId on the SocialCurrency settings screen.
1. You're all set!


== Screenshots ==
